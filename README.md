# Amazfit Pace Calendar Widget

After @Quinny899 's excellent work, we are able to make widget/apps! So, here is the first Calendar Widget for our Amazfit Pace!

## Installation (through ADB):
`adb install -r PaceCalendarWidget-1.1.apk`

## Uninstall (through ADB):
`adb uninstall com.dinodevs.pacecalendarwidget`

## Usage:
This app would be displayed as a widget after you reboot you watch (or the launcher). In order to move this widget you will need @Quinny899 's [Springboard Settings](https://forum.xda-developers.com/smartwatch/amazfit/app-springboard-settings-pace-rearrange-t3748651) app since it can't be moved through the phone app.

## Source:
This app is completely based on @Quinny899 's work with small changes , basically just the app layout. For more follow the XDA topic [[DEV] Create custom home screen pages for the Pace](https://forum.xda-developers.com/smartwatch/amazfit/dev-create-custom-home-screen-pages-pace-t3751731).
